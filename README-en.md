Hello, my name is Bruno. I believe that dialogue creates a foundation for collaboration and I am very interested in Infrastructure and Development! I enjoy working with programming languages such as Powershell, Bash, and Golang. I am very passionate about CI/CD and a big fan of Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions pipelines. I am fascinated by Cloud architecture, especially that of Azure. I like to automate the provisioning of applications in images like Docker. When it comes to provisioning infrastructure, I enjoy working with Terraform and Ansible, as well as some webservers. In short, I am a guy who really enjoys what he does and is always trying to do things that he's not capable of, in an attempt to learn how to do them.
